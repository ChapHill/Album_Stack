#Album Stack

School project. 
We were tasked to build our own stack implementation (as opposed to using the language built in method) and act as if we had a stack of albums and needed to put them into their corresponding stacks. 
I.e. if the album was a Rush album, throw it into a Rush album stack. If it was an Iron Maiden album, throw it into an Iron Maiden stack... etc.
